## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Media queries
- Grid Layout

### What I learned

With this project I learned to use some of the css grid layout properties applying them in the responsiveness as in the desktop version.

### Continued development

I intend to keep learning more and more. Here's a list of some specific things I'm looking to learn in the short term:

- Sass
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [A guide to css grid layout properties](https://origamid.com/projetos/grid/) - This helped me to get a direction on how I should apply using the css grid layout properties.
